                            Most college coaches are increasingly focusing their energy on recruiting international student-athletes to meet their coach’s team mission and vision. Coaches are not only looking for top international student-athletes; they are also looking for promising athletes they can integrate into their team. Additionally, they are looking for student-athletes with a strong character who will value their education and who will remain eligible throughout their college years. The current international recruiting process, however, is complex and inefficient. While every coach’s desire is to recruit the right international student-athlete for their program, many have encountered dishonesty, misinformation or corruption which has led to great frustration, disappointment, and distrust in recruiting internationally. .

                        <h2>Dont worry! RISA Got your back!!!</h2>
                        <p>RISA is a recruiting company which offers personal expertise with a wide network of coaches and prospective student-athletes. RISA uses the IVEN approach.</p>
                        <h3>What is IVEN?</h3>
                        <p>RISA is a recruiting company which offers personal expertise with a wide network of coaches and prospective student-athletes. RISA uses the IVEN approach. 
                            RISA’s vision is to make the international recruiting process more efficient, productive, and trustworthy. As RISA’s founder, David Cheromei, is very committed to using his personal experience as a Kenyan/American to help both coaches and international student-athletes in the recruiting process. He competed as an international student-athlete from Kenya, earned his undergraduate and Master’s degree in the United States, and twice coached at the university level in the United States. As a current resident of Kenya, he is committed to creating a network dedicated to providing quality and trustworthy services for both college coaches and international student-athletes. The founder and his team will be working from the ground (Kenya) to enable services to be more efficient and be available to prospective student-athletes. After launching, RISA will begin with Kenyan student-athletes with the aim of expanding its services to other international student-athletes from neighboring countries and beyond. 
                            RISA’s IVEN approach creates a successful platform where college coaches have the peace of mind to recruit the best international student-athletes for their program by identifying, verifying, equipping, and networking the prospective student-athletes to compete at the highest level.
